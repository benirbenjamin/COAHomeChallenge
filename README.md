<h1>COA Code Challenge</h1>

I wrote the code in Javascript, html and css.

To run the "Photo gallery" you need to open "index.html" file and see the output.
You can navigate through the code organized as index.html, main.js (under js folder) and style.css (under css folder).

There is a folder called "Challenges" where there are two challenges on arrayMap and stringTransform.
There in this folder you can find those challenges.

I used javascript to solve the problems and you can test inputs using your own inputs

To run my code in challenges, you need to run in terminal (node js or whatever) or in console.

Thanks
